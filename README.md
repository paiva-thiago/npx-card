# My npx card

Just my npx card. Inspired by [Glaucia's](https://imasters.com.br/desenvolvimento/cartao-pessoal-em-npx-e-possivel) and [Vue Vixen's](https://github.com/VueVixens/card) Cards and tutorials!

You can create yours by cloning this repo and customizing with your info in `data` (*bin/index.js line 9*). For publish in npm you must have a [NpmJS](http://npmjs.org) account.

# My npx card

Just my npx card. Inspired by [Glaucia's](https://imasters.com.br/desenvolvimento/cartao-pessoal-em-npx-e-possivel) and [Vue Vixen's](https://github.com/VueVixens/card) Cards and tutorials!

This version comes with personal data separated in a `.JSON` resources file. You can create yours by cloning this repo, but you must have a [NpmJS](http://npmjs.org) account.

## Important

If you've cloned this repository, you have to do a `npm install`. I did not put the dependencies here!
